# old-reddit-redirect
Google Chrome extension for redirecting the new reddit UI to the old reddit UI

### Motivation
After Reddit updated their website to their new user interface, a lot of subreddits
that had custom styling, or custom sidebars did not display correctly. This 
extension simply reroutes Reddit queries to the old Reddit domain that preserves
the old Reddit user interface.
